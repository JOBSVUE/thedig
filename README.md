# 🪨➜💎 Gemway API

Enrich data about someone (e.g job title, company, profile pictures etc.) using determinist, OSINT (Opensource Intelligence) and IA in a privacy-friendly way i.e only public data this person consent to share (no databreach) with the possibility to #OptOut.

## ✨ Features

Marketing-related data fetched from an email address and full name:
- Given name, Family name
- Job title
- Social Network's URL and LinkedIn's URL
- Profile pictures
- Company's name
- Work's location
- Home's location
- Nationality
- Language spoken

If a person add #OptOut to his social profile bio, he won't be mined.

## 🛡️ Privacy-by-design

This program intend to be actively GDPR compliant and respectful of mined person's privacy. Our intent is to help user's enrich data on existing contacts not to spy nor gather data on someone with a malicious purpose. We implemented proactively a few GDPR principles in the code itself:
- Right to Opt-Out: if the person mined use the tag #OptOut in its social profile, the enrichment will be stopped, the person's graph won't be enriched and the API's user will be noticed that the person Opted Out.
- Lawfulness, fairness and transparency: our sources of data are only public data the person already consent to share publicly. We do not mine databreached data nor doxing for examples. 
- Purpose and data limitation: This program intend to limit extracted personal data only to fields related with a confimed marketing purpose. Sensitive data are not mined.
- Accuracy: we rather prefer not to enrich with dubious information than take the risk of false positives, for examples the social profiles found are checked to be the ones about the person itself. We do not mine social networks or websites that are irrelevant to marketing purposes.
- Storage limitation: the data enriched are not stored except for cache purpose for a limited duration (default 24 hours)

By using this application, you must abid to local, international and ethical privacy rules. For instance, it's highly recommended to inform the person's enriched that he has been the object of this mining. Such feature is not in the scope of this present OpenSource repository. Please reach contact@ankaboot.fr for further enquiries.

## 🏗️ How to use

You'll need python 3.11, redis for cache, `gcloud` if you want an semi-automatic set-up, and a [few bunch of libraries](requirements.txt).

### Configure
To run this project, you'll need a few environement variables which includes some API keys from Google. Please edit [default.env](default.env) and rename it as `.env`.

You'll need a few API keys, at least Google Custom Search API and Google Vision (reverse-image search)
- [Create a custom search engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/all)  by specifying "\*.linkedin.com" as specific sites to search on (name here doesn't matter). Once created note the *ID* created and set it in the `.env` file as `GOOGLE_CX` variable. Then you'll need an [API key](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview#api_key). Be aware that such restricted search engine has a limited free plan, and you'll be billed above a limit defined by Google.
- Run `setup_google.sh` to set-up automatically Google Vision API. By default, the project will be `gemway`` and so the API key. If you wish to change defaults, feel free to modify the script by yourself.
  
You could also generate manually all Google API Keys for text search and JSON service-account keys for reverse-image search by doing the following steps:
  1. Visit https://console.developers.google.com and create a project.
  2. Visit https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/customsearch.googleapis.com and enable "Custom Search API" for your project.
  3. Visit https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials and generate API key credentials for your project.
  4. Visit https://cloud.google.com/vision/product-search/docs/auth and generate the JSON credential for your project.

Please remember that Google's API provides a limited free tier. For instance, the [Custom Search Site Restricted JSON API provides 100 search queries per day for free](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/site_restricted_api) and this program uses usually at least one search query per request.
