# 🪨➜💎 Transmutation API

Enrich data about someone (e.g employee name, title, profile pictures etc.) using OSINT (Opensource Intelligence) methods i.e only public data this person consent to share.

## ✨ Features

- First name, last name, title, profile picture, company name from LinkedIn using Google/Bing Search by email address and full name
- Company's name from an email address using whois on its domain
- Company's logo either favicon or open graph image (used for social networks)


## 🏗️ How to use

You'll need python 3.10 and a [few bunch of libraries](requirements.txt).

### Configure
To run this project, you'll need a few environement variables which includes some API keys. Please edit [default.env](default.env) and rename it as `.env`.

You'll need a few API keys, at least Google CustomSearch and Google Vision.
- [Create a custom search engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create)  by specifying "\*.linkedin.com" as restricted sites to search on. Once created note the *ID* created and set it in the `.env` file as `GOOGLE_CX` variable. Then you'll need an [API key](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview#api_key). 
- Run `setup_google.sh` to set-up automatically Google Vision API. By default, the project will be transmutation and so the API key. If you wish to change defaults, feel free to modify the script by yourself.

### Install

```bash
  pip install transmutation
```

### Launch
```bash
